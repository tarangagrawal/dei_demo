*next-pwa-application* is a demo progressive web application with offline support, server side rendering, with installable option and responsiveness.

### Features!
First off all check the [live demo](https://cocky-raman-3845d9.netlify.com/). Itâ€™s a pretty basic app, that server renders each one of the apps and caches, as we use the app, the requested resources (js, css, html and api requests).

Once you give a try while online, you can simulate a no connection scenario and see that the app keep still running.

If you using chrome browser (note that is a technology still under [development](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps)), you will notice a plus icon right after the location bar, there you can install the app, and play as if was a native application.
